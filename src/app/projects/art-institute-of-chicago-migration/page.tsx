            Many of my customers at Contentful were migrating from an existing
            CMS, and as such often needed to migrate <em>tons</em> of content
            over. Although Contentful's Management API makes it relatively
            straightforward to programmatically create content, the way in which
            you should scaffold your project is not immediately clear.

            to bridge the gap by showing how you could theoretically scaffold a
            project, while also providing examples for how to deal with some
            hidden Contentful gotchas (i.e. API rate limits). Overall, this was
            a super fun project to work on, as it let me flex some of my backend
            chops while also providing some real value for my customers ðŸ’ª
