            This one was incredibly fun to build, and was also for a great
            cause! This location search combines Drupal's powerful Search API,
            hospital location data from Epic, and Vue 3 + Google's Maps API for
            the frontend, giving users a quick and intuitive way to find
            healthcare providers for their specific location and needs.

            There are definitely some hurdles when it comes to using Drupal in a
            headless manner; however, for smaller single page applications
            things are quite a bit easier. Additionally, contributed modules
            allow the use of things like GraphQL, making querying for data{" "}
            <em>much</em> easier. Drupal's Search API (powered by Apache Solr)
            is extremely powerful, and lets us do cool things like proximity
            search based on latitude/longitude coordinates with minimal effort.

            This was one of my first end-to-end Vue projects, and admittedly
            performance could be a bit better; however, I think it runs really
            well, the interface is intuitive, and is overall pretty slick ðŸ˜Ž
